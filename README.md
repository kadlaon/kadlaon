### Hi! Welcome to my space, very pleased to e-meet you. 
You are here for a reason, and for whatever reason that is, I'm glad. We may not be acquainted in person but I'm happy to let you know the things I enjoy doing. Go look around my lair and if you want to connect please do 📧 [send me an email](mailto:kristineadlaontekkie@gmail.com) or better yet let's meet for some coffee ♨️ and discuss how we can make this planet a better place to live. If not, maybe we can talk about how adorable cats 😽 are or maybe how we can appreciate life even more? 

Looking forward to meeting you!
